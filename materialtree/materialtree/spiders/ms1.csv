Concrete can be converted into precast masonry units of suitable size to be used for walling. The blocks can be cast to desired shape and size to facilitate construction of wall of requisite thickness and appearance.A thickness as low as 15cm is feasible for a load bearing wall and 10 cm for a non-load bearing wall, adopting solid\r\nconcrete blocks. They are also suitable for, filling, weatherboarding or other forms of surface cladding. Due to its high density, higher strengths can be achieved and excellent properties are offered for sound insulation, and fixing. This does not impose any structural problems within the masonry units, as the strength of block is fairly consistent in all directions.'"
